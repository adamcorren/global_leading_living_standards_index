## Index Objective 

The objective of the Leading Living Standards Index is 
to compile a list of the foremost countries to reside in. 
To accomplish this, an analysis will be conducted 
employing a comprehensive set of 48 distinct metrics. 
These metrics encompass a wide array of indexes, 
surveys, and annual data points, collectively forming a 
detailed framework for assessing living standards.

## Index Benchmarks

The Global Leading Living Standards Index focuses on 
identifying the best countries to live in, rather than 
ranking every country / identifying the worst. To ensure 
a higher standard for inclusion in the index, a set of 
benchmark criteria is introduced. A country must meet 
all four of these benchmarks to be included:
- Democracy: The presence of a functioning 
democratic system that ensures citizens' 
participation and representation in governance.

- Safety: A basic level of safety and security that 
allows for a safe environment for citizens to thrive.
A country must have a travelsafe.com safety index
score of at least 50 (out of 100).

- Economy: Economic stability and opportunities 
that support sustainable growth and prosperity. A 
country must rank in the top 100 countries globally
in gross domestic product (GDP).

- Availability of metrics: A minimum of 40 out of 
the 48 metrics must be available for a country.

Out of the 161 countries that offered current data for
the democracy, safety, and economic benchmarks, a 
total of 47 countries met all 3. Among these countries, 
six (Luxembourg, Slovakia, Latvia, Ghana, Ecuador, and 
Sri Lanka) did not have at least 40 indicator data points 
available. As a result, only 41 out of a possible 161
countries qualified for inclusion in the 2023 Global
Leading Living Standards Index.

## Index Framework 

Once the qualified countries have been identified, they 
are subjected to an analysis across four different 
subindices, each representing a significant area of living 
standards. These subindices encompass various 
aspects that contribute to the overall quality of life 
within a country and allow for a broad understanding of 
the strengths and weaknesses of each Nation.

- Economic health and stability: Evaluates a country's 
capacity to maintain a stable and well-managed 
economic environment, shedding light on its ability to 
provide favourable economic conditions for its citizens.

- Quality of life: Encompasses a broad spectrum of 
factors that collectively contribute to the overall wellbeing and satisfaction within a country. It is the most 
significant and heavily weighted subindex as it captures 
crucial dimensions that directly impact the daily lives 
and happiness of citizens.

- Cost of living: Focuses on assessing the general prices 
and expenses associated with living in a particular 
country, as well as providing insights into the 
affordability and financial implications of residing in a 
country.

- Growth and development: Assesses the current and
potential for future economic growth, development, 
and overall living standards, offering insights into the 
positive or negative trajectory of a countryâ€™s living
standards.
