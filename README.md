## Index Benchmarks

The Global Leading Living Standards Index focuses on 
identifying the best countries to live in, rather than 
ranking every country / identifying the worst. To ensure 
a relatively high standard for inclusion in the index, a set 
of benchmark criteria is introduced. A country must 
meet all four of these benchmarks to be included:

- Democracy:  The presence of a democratic system
that ensures citizens' participation and
representation.

- Safety: : A basic level of safety and security that
allows for a safe environment for citizens. A
country must have a travelsafe.com safety index
score of at least 50 (out of 100).

- Economy: Economic stability and opportunities
that support sustainable growth. A country must
rank in the top 100 countries globally in gross
domestic product (GDP).

- Availability of metrics:  A minimum of 40 out of
the 48 metrics must be available.

Out of the 161 countries that offered current data for
the democracy, safety, and economic benchmarks, a 
total of 47 countries met all 3. Among these countries, 
six (Luxembourg, Slovakia, Latvia, Ghana, Ecuador, and 
Sri Lanka) did not have at least 40 indicator data points 
available. As a result, only 41 out of a possible 161
countries qualified for inclusion in the 2023 Global
Leading Living Standards Index.
